# ShopStockAdmin
Business Panel


I typically use the conda terminal to run the django database but any python shell will work, and it can be ran through python shell within the folder 
Steps:
1. Download to desktop or wherever you can allocate space.
2. Run python shell and run 'cd Desktop' or whatever file directory and then 'cd ShopStock'
3. Run 'python manage.py createsuperuser' to create username, enter email and password 
4. Run 'python manage.py runserver to run the server 
5. go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ (or whatever the development server is followed by '/admin/)
